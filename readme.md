## Skills Assessment

Attached are three states of a new contacts widget. This widget will be used across multiple sites. Designers will also use this in mocks for usability tests. Please create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the widget as described in the attached images.  See how far you can make it in *3 hours*, but you don't need to spend any more than 3 hours on your solution. You will be asked to explain any places where your solution does not match the spec.  Please target modern browsers (FF7/Chrome/Safari), try not to use images (other than the avatar), and bonus points for graceful degradation and legacy support solutions.
